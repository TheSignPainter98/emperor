# Emperor

## * Introduction

## * Feature List

## Emperor
- nice warning and error output 
- asdf
- automatic parallelisation of tasks through separate spawned queues
- Packages (accessed by dot notation) have constants and pure functions, are syntactic sugar for sole classes—dependencies are superclasses
- Objects have constants and pure functions and multiple inheritance, functions can be overridden and inherited; accessible by dot notation
    - Constructor has separate name
- Set/range types tuples, parametric types
- Procedural constructs: `if`, `while`, `for`, `foreach` 
- functions can have optional arguments (must have specified default value)
- Packages can be included with aliases
- Constants can be passed by reference, variables passed by copy to pure functions
- Impure functions may only be called from other, impure functions.
- The entry-point can either be pure or impure
- Inheritance and Interfaces
- Compile-Time Extensions—scripts which can generate code to compile—note that this may only be done in new files according to an API for the AST
